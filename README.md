# My Tech Blog Project - A Full-Stack Application Journey

## Project Synopsis

Welcome to my Tech Blog project, a full-stack web application that I've developed to showcase my skills in modern web development. This application is built on an Express.js API and uses Sequelize for smooth interactions with a MySQL database. It's a great example of how to use database schema and seed commands for setting up and populating databases. I've also implemented RESTful API routes, including GET, POST, and DELETE, to handle data across different tables efficiently.

One of the highlights of this project is its user authentication system, which ensures secure access and provides a personalized experience for each user. For the front end, I've used Handlebars.js to render views dynamically, making the interface interactive and engaging. Plus, I've integrated a variety of npm packages to streamline development and add more features.

## Setting It Up Locally
